# Perseids <br> Project 3 from the course FYS3150 of University of Oslo, Autumn 2017

The goal of this project is to compute a simulation of the Solar System with both Euler's and Verlet's algorithms to solve the ordinary differential equations combined with Newton's law.

## Implementation

The program is object oriented and uses two classes : `planet` which encapsulated the fundamental data of a celestial body such as its position, velocity, mass and its energies as well.
